Against all odds, But soon against ourselves.\nYou haunted every memory\nWith no goodbyes, all bad for me\nYour pride put out the fire in our flames\nThen just one look is all it takes\nI feel your eyes they\u2019re locked on every part of me\nThen my dumb heart says...\n\nJust look up\nThere is no place to hide...\nTrue love doesn\u2019t die, it holds on tight and never lets you go\nJust look up!\nYou cannot deny the signs...\nWhat you\u2019ve waited for, don\u2019t wait no more.\nIt\u2019s right up above you. Just look up!\n\n(Baby) Know I let you down a n---- can\u2019t deny it (Uh uh)\nAnd there\u2019s so much I could lose and yes that matters (yeah)\nI\u2019ve been dealing with madness (yo)\nWasn\u2019t the man you needed\nYou dealing with sadness\nTruthfully it\u2019s all on me\nAnd I\u2019m sorry my love Imma heal your heart\nI\u2019ll hold it in my hand\nTime is ohh so precious, we don\u2019t really have much left now \nTake my hand baby Never leave you Riley \n\nLook up\nWhat he\u2019s really trying to say\nIs get your head out of your\nAnd listen to the goddamn qualified scientists\nWe really messed it up, messed it up this time\nIt\u2019s so close I can feel the heat big time\nYou can act like everything is alright\nbut this is probably happening in real time\n\nCelebrate, Or cry or pray ...\nWhatever it takes to get you through the mess that we made!\nCause, tomorrow may never come!\n\nJust look up\nTurn off that crazy news\nCause you\u2019re about to die soon everybody!\nLook up\nHere it comes\nI\u2019m so glad I\u2019m here with you\nForever in your arms\n\n#ArianaGrande #KIdCudi #JustLookUp #DontLookUp\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/5M9gVO",

Against all odds, But soon against ourselves.\nYou haunted every memory\nWith no goodbyes, all bad for me\nYour pride put out the fire in our flames\nThen just one look is all it takes\nI feel your eyes they\u2019re locked on every part of me\nThen my dumb heart says...\n\nJust look up\nThere is no place to hide...\nTrue love doesn\u2019t die, it holds on tight and never lets you go\nJust look up!\nYou cannot deny the signs...\nWhat you\u2019ve waited for, don\u2019t wait no more.\nIt\u2019s right up above you. Just look up!\n\n(Baby) Know I let you down a n---- can\u2019t deny it (Uh uh)\nAnd there\u2019s so much I could lose and yes that matters (yeah)\nI\u2019ve been dealing with madness (yo)\nWasn\u2019t the man you needed\nYou dealing with sadness\nTruthfully it\u2019s all on me\nAnd I\u2019m sorry my love Imma heal your heart\nI\u2019ll hold it in my hand\nTime is ohh so precious, we don\u2019t really have much left now \nTake my hand baby Never leave you Riley \n\nLook up\nWhat he\u2019s really trying to say\nIs get your head out of your\nAnd listen to the goddamn qualified scientists\nWe really messed it up, messed it up this time\nIt\u2019s so close I can feel the heat big time\nYou can act like everything is alright\nbut this is probably happening in real time\n\nCelebrate, Or cry or pray ...\nWhatever it takes to get you through the mess that we made!\nCause, tomorrow may never come!\n\nJust look up\nTurn off that crazy news\nCause you\u2019re about to die soon everybody!\nLook up\nHere it comes\nI\u2019m so glad I\u2019m here with you\nForever in your arms\n\n#ArianaGrande #KIdCudi #JustLookUp #DontLookUp\n\nhttp://vevo.ly/5M9gVO"

\nBut somethin bout it felt like home somehow \nAnd I left my scarf there at your sister\u2019s house \nAnd you\u2019ve still got it in your drawer even now \nOh your sweet disposition, and my wide eyed gaze \nWe\u2019re singing in the car getting lost upstate\nAutumn leaves falling down like pieces into place \nAnd I can picture it after all these days \nAnd I know it\u2019s long gone and that magic\u2019s not here no more \nAnd I might be ok but I\u2019m not fine at all\u2026\n\nCause there we are again on that \nLittle town street \nYou almost ran the red \nCause you were looking over at me \nWind in my hair, I was there \nI remember it all too well\n\nPhoto album on the counter \nYour cheeks were turning red\nYou used to be a little kid with glasses\nin a twin-sized bed \nAnd your mother\u2019s telling stories bout you on \nthe tee ball team \nYou taught me bout your past \nThinkin your future was me\nAnd you were tossing me the car keys \n\u2018F*** the patriarchy\u2019 keychain on the ground\nWe were always skipping town\nAnd I was thinking on the drive down\nAny time now, he\u2019s gonna say it\u2019s love\nYou never called it what it was\ntil we were dead and gone and buried \nCheck the pulse and come back \nSwearing it\u2019s the same, after 3 months in the grave\nAnd then you wondered where it went to\nAs I reached for you but\nAll I felt was shame\nAnd you held my lifeless frame \nAnd I know it\u2019s long gone and \nThere was nothing else I could do \nAnd I forget about you long enough\nTo forget why I needed to\u2026 \n\nCause there we are again in the middle of the night\nWe\u2019re dancin round the kitchen in the \nrefrigerator light\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI remember it all too well\u2026\nAnd there we are again \nWhen nobody had to know\nYou kept me like a secret\nBut I kept you like an oath\nSacred prayer and we\u2019d swear \nto remember it all too well \n\nWell maybe we got lost in translation \nMaybe I asked for too much\nBut maybe this thing was a masterpiece\nTil you tore it all up\nRunning scared, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nAnd you call me up again \nJust to break me like a promise \nSo casually cruel in the name of being honest \nI\u2019m a crumpled up piece of paper lying here\nCause I remember it all, all, all \nThey say all\u2019s well that ends well\nBut I\u2019m in a new hell every time\nYou double-cross my mind\nYou said if we had been closer in age\nMaybe it would have been fine\nAnd that made me want to die.\n\nThe idea you had of me\nWho was she?\nA never-needy, ever lovely jewel\nWhose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened\nYou.\nThat\u2019s what happened: You.\nYou, who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you were on a late night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door \nall night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \u201cit\u2019s supposed to be fun\u2026 \nTurning 21\u201d \n\nTime won\u2019t fly\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m paralyzed by it \nI\u2019d like to be my old self again\nBut I\u2019m still trying to find it \nAfter plaid shirt days \nAnd nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things \nAnd I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf\nFrom that very first week\nCause it reminds you of innocence, and it smells like me \nYou can\u2019t get rid of it\nCause you remember it all too well\n\nCause there we are again when\nI loved you so \nBack before you lost the one real thing\nYou\u2019ve ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there \nYou remember it all \nDown the stairs, you were there \nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes \nBut the punchline goes:\n\u201cI\u2019ll get older, but your lovers stay my age\u201d\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI\u2019m a soldier who\u2019s returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you too?\nCause in this city\u2019s barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\nJust between us did the love affair maim you \nAll too well\nJust between us, do you remember it \nAll too well\nJust between us, I remember it all too well\n\nWind in my hair \nI was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI was there\nSacred prayer\nI was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nAll too well

jewel\nWhose shine reflects on you\nNot weeping in a party bathroom\nSome actress asking me what happened\nYou.\nThat\u2019s what happened: You.\nYou, who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSipping coffee like you were on a late night show\nBut then he watched me watch the front door \nall night, willing you to come\nAnd he said, \u201cit\u2019s supposed to be fun\u2026 \nTurning 21\u201d \n\nTime won\u2019t fly\nIt\u2019s like I\u2019m paralyzed by it \nI\u2019d like to be my old self again\nBut I\u2019m still trying to find it \nAfter plaid shirt days \nAnd nights when you made me your own\nNow you mail back my things \nAnd I walk home alone\nBut you keep my old scarf\nFrom that very first week\nCause it reminds you of innocence, and it smells like me \nYou can\u2019t get rid of it\nCause you remember it all too well\n\nCause there we are again when\nI loved you so \nBack before you lost the one real thing\nYou\u2019ve ever known\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\nWind in my hair, you were there \nYou remember it all \nDown the stairs, you were there \nYou remember it all\nIt was rare, I was there\nI remember it all too well\n\nAnd I was never good at telling jokes \nBut the punchline goes:\n\u201cI\u2019ll get older, but your lovers stay my age\u201d\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI\u2019m a soldier who\u2019s returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you too?\nCause in this city\u2019s barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\nJust between us did the love affair maim you \nAll too well\nJust between us, do you remember it \nAll too well\nJust between us, I remember it all too well\n\nWind in my hair \nI was there, I was there\nDown the stairs, I was there\nI was there\nSacred prayer\nI was there, I was there\nIt was rare, you remember it\nAll too well  \n\n#taylorswift #redtaylorsversion #taylorsversion"
