                "description": "No survey of America's worst presidents would be complete without our 14th president, Franklin Pierce, whose reputation for amiability and good looks (and his introduction of perforated postage stamps) was offset by his support for the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act, which led to clashes between pro- and anti-slavery forces. Correspondent Mo Rocca looks at the legacy of a president whose actions in office brought the nation closer to civil war.\n\n\"CBS Sunday Morning\" features stories on the arts, music, nature, entertainment, sports, history, science and Americana, and highlights unique human accomplishments and achievements.

Correspondent Mo Rocca looks at the legacy of a president whose actions in office brought the nation closer to civil war.\n\n\"CBS Sunday Morning\" features stories on the arts, music, nature, entertainment, sports, history, science and Americana, and highlights unique human accomplishments and achievements.

He would overcome thoughts of suicide to compose his masterwork: the Ninth Symphony and its optimistic final movement, \"Ode to Joy.\" Correspondent Mo Rocca talks with biographer Jan Swafford and conductor Marin Alsop about Beethoven's incredible triumph over terrible mental and physical suffering; and with a hearing specialist who has created a simulation of how Beethoven actually heard his music.\n\n\"CBS Sunday Morning\" features stories on the arts, music, nature, entertainment, sports, history, science and Americana, and highlights unique human accomplishments and achievements.

                    "description": "Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) was a composer of extraordinary gifts, but a lifetime of maladies \u2013 including the almost-total loss of his hearing \u2013 threatened his ability to write music. He would overcome thoughts of suicide to compose his masterwork: the Ninth Symphony and its optimistic final movement, \"Ode to Joy.\" Correspondent Mo Rocca talks with biographer Jan Swafford and conductor Marin Alsop about Beethoven's incredible triumph over terrible mental and physical suffering; and with a hearing specialist who has created a simulation of how Beethoven actually heard his music.\n\n\"CBS Sunday Morning\" features stories on the arts, music, nature, entertainment, sports, history, science and Americana, and highlights unique human accomplishments and achievements.
