                                       'in the field of vision. They may look '
                                       'like blobs, little worms or cobwebs '
                                       'that move with the eye’s movement. '
                                       'They seem impossible to focus on and '
                                       'are most visible when looking against '
                                       'a bright plain background such as a '
                                       'blue sky or a blank computer screen. '
                                       'Floaters are in fact particles '
                                       'suspended inside the vitreous body – '
                                       'the gel-like structure that fills the '
                                       'space between the lens and the retina. '
                                       'What we see, however, are not the '
                                       'floaters themselves, but the shadows '
                                       'they cast on the retina. The closer '
                                       'they are to the retina, the larger and '
                                       'clearer they appear in the field of '
                                       'vision. Commonly, floaters develop as '
                                       'part of normal aging. With age, the '
                                       'gel-like vitreous body undergoes '
                                       'syneresis – a process in which water '
                                       'is separated from solid components, '
                                       'creating pockets of fluid that are '
                                       'perceived by the patient as blobs or '
                                       'little worms. The major structural '
                                       'protein of the vitreous – collagen '
                                       'fibrils – become denatured, clump '
                                       'together and can be seen as floating '
                                       'strings or cobwebs. The fluid pockets '
                                       'may collapse, causing the vitreous to '
                                       'shrink and pull away from the retina. '
                                       'This pulling exerts mechanical '
                                       'stimulations on the retina, producing '
                                       '"flashes of light" or photopsias in '
                                       'peripheral vision. Eventually, the '
                                       'vitreous is separated from the retina. '
                                       'This is known as posterior vitreous '
                                       'detachment or PVD. PVD is very common '
                                       'but is generally benign and does not '
                                       'require treatment. The floaters may be '
                                       'a nuisance to vision, but in most '
                                       'people, the brain will eventually '
                                       'learn to ignore them. Complications '
                                       'may happen, however, in a small number '
                                       'of cases. As the vitreous detaches, it '
                                       'may pull the retina with it, resulting '
                                       'in a retinal tear. Fluid from the '
                                       'vitreous may then sip through the tear '
                                       'and cause the retina to separate from '
                                       'the underlying tissue. This is known '
                                       'as retinal detachment and is a '
                                       'sight-threatening condition. Worrying '
                                       'signs to watch out for include: - A '
                                       'sudden increase in number of new '
                                       'floaters, especially tiny ones as '
                                       'these may represent pigments or blood '
                                       'cells released from the damaged retina '
                                       'or blood vessels. - A shade or curtain '

                                       'from the detached part of the retina. '
                                       'People with high degree of myopia are '
                                       'at higher risks of having PVD. The '

                                       'increases the likelihood of PVD and '
